# Conversational AI

hyunGPT leverages advanced natural language processing models to enable natural, multi-turn conversations.

## Key Features

- **Contextual awareness** - Understands conversation history and context to provide relevant responses.

- **Multi-turn capability** - Can engage in long, coherent dialogues with back-and-forth exchanges.

- **Dynamic responses** - Generates unique responses tailored to the conversation, not canned replies.

- **Natural language** - Processes input and responds in natural human language, not robotic speak.

- **Personalities** - Can take on different personas with unique speaking styles.

- **Continuity** - Conversation state and history is preserved across interactions. 

## How It Works

- Uses GPT models like GPT-3.5 Turbo for text generation.

- Conversation context is tracked in persistent storage.

- Messages are processed by the bot and responses generated.

- Advanced techniques like prompt engineering enable natural conversations.

- Members can customize bot personality and behavior.

## Limitations

- May occasionally generate incorrect or nonsensical responses.

- Limited by model capabilities and training data.

- Subject to platform constraints like message size limits.

## Improving Quality

User feedback helps train the models to improve response quality over time. Features like voting and subscriptions fund access to more advanced AI.
