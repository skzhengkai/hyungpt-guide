# Image Recognition

hyunGPT can analyze image attachments using advanced computer vision AI.

## Capabilities

- Processes attached images to understand their contents.

- Generates captions describing the key objects, people, and activities depicted.

- Allows having natural conversations about images posted in chat.

- Can incorporate image descriptions into responses.

## How It Works

- Uses computer vision models to identify objects in images.

- Conceptualizes the relationships between objects to generate captions.

- Integrates image captions into the conversation context.

- Describes images in natural language in responses.

## Examples

User: *shares image of a dog catching a frisbee* 

hyunGPT: Cute! It looks like there is a golden retriever jumping to catch a frisbee in the park. I love seeing dogs have fun playing fetch.

## Limitations

- Quality depends on the computer vision model used.

- May not identify all objects correctly, especially in complex images. 

- Captions are not perfect descriptions and may miss key points.

- Access Requires voting on top.gg or a premium subscription.

## Improving Quality

More advanced vision models, training data, and user feedback will enhance image recognition over time.
